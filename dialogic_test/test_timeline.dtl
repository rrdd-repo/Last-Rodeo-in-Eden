It was hard not to let the encouragement go to my head after hearing such childish glee. [n+]\
I then felt the pelting of grabs against my back as he went wild, checking pocket after pocket.

It feels like I've been asleep forever...[n+]\\
I returned to reality in slow motion. In minutes, hours, or seconds, I realized I was in a hospital.
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch5/hospitalbed.png" fade="0.5"]
But more confusingly...[n+]\\
Why was I alive?
I had been spared, for whatever reason.[n+]\\
I don't get it. Was all talk for nothing? Did the gunshot sound scare an onlooker?
All that talk about taking me back for nothing. Bleh.
[wait time="0.5"]
A nurse walked into the room, with an unbothered look on your face.
nurse: Patient, can I get your name?
john: John, I think.
nurse: John, you were recovered with a gunshot to the abdomen.[n+]\\
We can help stabilize you, but extensive care may be expensive. Do you have the funds?
Ugh...[n+]\\
As pathetic as it is to admit, this bullet-wound could still pull me into the darkness.
nurse: I'll check in on you later. We have a phone for you if you want to call any family members.
john: Later, thanks.[n+]\\
I need some time to think.
She gave a professional smile and walked away.
The moment I had given myself a moment to think, the dam broke.[n+]\\
Every emotion--every side of me--had burst out all at once.
common/protagonist: This is all my fault!!![n+]\\
If I had done more to help him back then, maybe things wouldn't have gone so wrong....
john: Did I really owe them that, though?[n+]\\
I wanted to help them, but It's not my responsibility to be their brain.
common/fillername3: But they were all I had. [n+]\\
I could've fought harder for them, and it would've been worth it.
john: If they were swayed that easily, it was inevitable they'd be manipulated.
common/fillername3: I just had no idea how to stop them from being manipulated.[n+]\\
I ruled out anyone other than me being able to help, after all.
common/protagonist: But there was no one else in that world I could trust.\\
I was alone. My parents were deeply afraid of anyone who wasn't at my school or our neighbors.
john: As an adult, I understand the wider social context for why my parents were so scared of anyone who wasn't on the school registry.[n+]\\
That whole generation got groomed into sensationalism.
john: We grew up in the razors-in-halloween-candy decade.[n+]\\
It could never have had any other outcome.
common/fillername3: Which is why in a sense--Saturn was totally right.[n+]\\
If we wanted to save people like them, we had to change the world for the better!! We could've fought harder!!
common/fillername3: We could've made educational videos or something, could've convinced our parents through our teachers.[n+]\\
Could've done something. Maybe if we tried hard enough, we'd find something.
john: Ehehe...thinking about how I could change the past is just idealism.[n+]\\
I should let go of all of this, and just try to be a better person now.
common/protagonist: But..how can we forgive ourselves for the past, when the future hasn't changed?[n+]\\
Saturn is still out there, in a world that never found a place for them.
common/fillername3: That world made us all worse. It's a miracle I made it out of there myself.[n+]\\
No one was in control of that situation.
common/protagonist: If the chance of a good outcome was always that slim, were our parents right to butt their heads in, to stop those interactions from happening?
john: Thinking like that makes me feel incredibly, incredibly sad.[n+]\\
Their fear of it is exactly why we couldn't find a way to make it safer.
common/fillername3: When we grow up, I guess we'll have to become the future generation that's more open-minded about this sorta thing.[n+]
common/fillername3: Both Saturn and I grew up in solitude.[n+]\\
Solitude is what made our bond so strong, but its what made them so susceptible to other isolated people's manipulation.
And we were as susceptible to that damage as they were.[n+]\\
\\
But for some reason. only they're the one with the heart that could never heal.
I was...so lucky. [n+]\\
I was never as burdened by it as them, but here I am--stuck in some hospital bed.
Even considering the thought that the old guard was right to judge Saturn, just because the worst outcome came to fruition.[n+]\\
I couldn't believe what I was thinking.
I had been stupid this whole time not to realize that.[n+]\\
I had been stupid to think for a second that my heart wasn't in the right place to keep searching.
common/fillername3: Then I guess I can't ever give up that childish wish.[n+]\\
To try and change the world, make it a better place\: that is the life of a magical girl.
# ahhhhh
ch1eve: Heyyyaaa Ygg!!!!
They waved their hand wildly.
common/fillername3: Umm..hey............how are you doing..?
ch1eve: Nothing without you, ehehe!!
I love you, Ygg. I'm here to reap you, my most bountiful harvest.[n+]\
We'll laugh,[n+] and we'll play,[n+] [ns=0.5]and we'll change the wor----
I'm just[lspeed=0.05]..not cut out for any of this.[n+]\
The human world is my world. I thought I didn't belong here, but I did. It's not my right to change it.
[pause=1][ns=0.5]Bitterness.
The vulnerability I had let out of myself around Saturn[pause=0.1]--I have to hide it again.[n+]\
Being forced to live in the light after taking comfort in the blanket of darkness...it felt like I was naked.
I can't blame them for being unnecessarily suspicious this time, they're right at this point.[n+]\
[ns=0.1]Self-loathing.
I looked at the clock. It was just past midnight.[n+]\
I knew my parents were already deep asleep at this point[pause=0.1]--which relieved me--[pause=0.1]but asked them to keep their voice down.
They said it with a defensive inflection, as if I was thinking they were a coward.[n+]\\
I figured I'd just leave it for now.

It usually wasn't a long trip home from this part of town, but Saturn's shyness added a lot of delays. \\
But eventually, we ended up here--standing before a lone windowsill in my backyard.
[pause=0.3][lspeed=0.08]Hey, Saturn, I have an idea.[n+]\
This might be crazy, but...if you want to play that game so bad, do you want to come to my place?

Ughhh... Was I always so desperate for the attention of another? I'm thinking so pathetically.[n+][pause=2]\\
As if to shake off the weariness, I shake my head, but accidentally open my eyes for a moment.

I only see it for a second. The boy's shirt and shorts are ripped up like they'd been chewed on. [n+]\\
But I close my eyes with a flinch at the realization I had done, only for the swing set to crash into me.
[ns=0.5]Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
YAHOOOO!!!!!! â™ªâ™ª
[lspeed=8]Games?? I loooove games!! It's been so long since I last played games, give me them please!! \
Just for a little bit, I promise I'll return them!!
That's all I ask of you, kind stranger!! But... I am glad to talk to someone, ehehe.\
Follow through my requests, and I might return the favor! âœ©

That surreal night was the consequence of a series of coincidences that had all started six weeks ago. [n+]\
It started out of desperation. I was crawling out of the burning light, and fell into darkness.
...I guess I better get going.
