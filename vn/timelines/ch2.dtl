I woke up hugging my pillow. [n+]\
I wasn't ready to let go of this feeling, was I?
Not much happened today. I wish I had stories to tell you, but I spent the day as I always do--[pause=0.3]alone.
I had stopped by the doctor.[n+]\
She asked me how I got scraped, so I told her I played on a swing set.
But despite that being the only thing I remembered from the whole day, it had gone by dreadfully, dreadfully slow. [n+]\
It was a day riddled with anxiety, a day dominated by the thoughts of one thing.

The split second I hadn't paid attention, the clock strikes the golden number. [n+]\
As I grab my backpack, I look under my door to thankfully see the lights are off outside.

I walked briskly to the park, wondering if maybe I should've come earlier, or waited.[n+]\
That kid looked a little feral... Am I sure they'll even know what time I was there last night?

Well, only time will tell. We're here.
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch1/gardeneyesclosed.png" fade="0.1" transition="Simple Fade"]
I step to the center of the playground, and close my eyes as tight as I can. [n+]\
Maybe my brain thinks they'd show up if I squinted harder.
Time begins to pass, I can tell because my breathing has ceased.[n+]\
How many seconds has it been?[pause=0.2] 2?[pause=0.3] 8?[pause=0.1] Forever?

The noise of something falling onto the gravel rings out in front of me.
questionmark: Heya, 'got you this!!
[music fade="0.0" volume="0.0"]
[sound path="res://vn/sfx/ch2/anime-46068.mp3" volume="0.0"]
common/protagonist: AAAACKK!!![n+]\
Aahh, you should've said something first!! I[pause=0.2]...I didn't know you were even here!!
[music path="res://vn/music/ch1/the-place-we-dreamed-of-231049.mp3" fade="0.0" volume="0.0"]
They had taken advantage of my weak point...walking inches from my face while my eyes were closed. [n+]\
Now that I was done with fear, the next emotion in line was joy. I was about to process my own joy.
I wanted to hug them, but the first thing I needed to do was see what his gift was.[n+]\
I knelt down, fumbling through feelings on the floor until I recognized I was touching fabric.
ch1eve: I brought you an outfit! I wanted to give you a seeeecret identity for our seeeeeecret base!!
common/protagonist: Putting on an outfit in the dark? That might be your toughest request yet...\
Would you mind stepping behind a tree, or something? Just for a second.
ch1eve: Roger that, aye aye captain!
[sound path="res://vn/sfx/ch1/walking-in-gravel-91427.mp3" volume="0.0"]
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch2/thegarden2.png" fade="4.0"]
I hear a mischievous splash of gravel as they run off. [n+]\
Opening my eyes, I'm surprised to see such an elaborate design in front of me.
I put it on top of the layer of clothes I had on; I couldn't risk taking any further suspicion if I came home with dirty clothes.
It was luxurious and frilly, emanating the aura of the sort of clothing priests wore.[n+]\
I swore it also felt a bit dusty, as if it had been lying in some closet for a long time.
I considered asking if this had been stolen from the local church, but didn't think I'd get a straight answer regardless.
common/protagonist: I'm dooooone, you can come out now.[n+]\
I'll shut my eyes tight real quick.
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch2/thegarden2.png" fade="0.1"]
[wait time="3.0"]
But for some reason, I heard nothing. And nothing began to last a long time.[n+]\
Was this their final gift, or something?
[sound path="res://vn/sfx/ch2/bubble-sound-43207.mp3" volume="0.0"]
Suddenly, I felt a tap on my shoulder.
Accck...\
Looking behind me on raw instinct, I was greeted by the sight of someone in an even more sophisticated getup.
...Disappointingly, I still couldn't get a good look at their face--it was covered in a veil-esque mask.
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch2/thegarden2.png" fade="0.1" transition="Swipe Right To Left"]
ch1eve: Ehehehe!!! You thought you were special, didn't you!!
common/protagonist: Nuh uh. Well, I guess I didn't consider this was your plan.
ch1eve: It's just most comfortable this way. I gave you your own, too!![n+]\
Now...for the real hard part. We must come up with names for our alter egos of the night!
Something told me this kid is quite insecure about their true identity.[n+]\
But I've had enough fun with them so far, I don't mind playing superhero. I'll humour this.
ch1eve: Alright, I'll start!![lspeed=0.1] ...............Ummm............ Aiiii... can't think of anything...
common/protagonist: You're naming yourself, right? Think about what you identify with, what you envision as yourself.
ch1eve: Hmmmm...I wanna change the world, and I wanna make the world a better place.[n+]\
And, when I'm done, everyone will let me rule over them!! Cuz I'm just that nice, ehe!!
common/protagonist: First of all, ruling the world is not a personality trait, sorry. [n+]\
Second of all, so, you wanna rule *over* the world? How about naming yourself after the sky or something?
ch1eve: I want to be higher than the sky!!!
common/protagonist: How about a planet?
ch1eve: Planets?...I remember Mars, Pluto, Jupiter...[pause=0.3]\
....ooooh, Saturn sounds coolest!
common/protagonist: But magical fighters against evil are named after planets are kinda overused, aren't they?
ch1eve: Common names aren't a problem, you just have to put a number at the end!!! Here, watch this!![n+]\
Fear not, citizens...for it is I! Savior Saturn4110!!
That wasn't smooth at all....but I'm not one to speak yet. [n+]\
I'll just wing it.
common/protagonist: ...A[pause=0.1]-and it is I, Savior Yggdrasil!!!![lspeed=0.1]....413.
I picked a random thing from my favourite video game...
common/fillername4: The name you picked is kinda complicated...I don't wanna say that all the time now!![n+]\
I've got my eyes on you, Ygg-Ygg!!
The improv caught me off guard, but it oddly felt right. [n+]\
My real name stopped feeling like it meant something when it was only used professionally.
[wait time="0.5"]
common/fillername4: You know what that means, Yggy!!\
From now on, we're no longer lowly and powerless...but heroes of the night!!!
common/fillername3: Uh huh.[n+]\
So....what do we do, as magical girls or whatever?
common/fillername4: Our journey *reaaaally* starts here!!
Their posture leans in seriously, in a way that precedes the nonchalant way they spoke.
common/fillername3: Yeah, but like... journeys have movement, y'know?
Without words, Saturn ran off, before quickly coming back with a stick in hand. [n+]\
They began furiously drawing away at the gravel, painting a little explanation of their grand scheme.
They doodled two stick figures standing on the Earth with crowns.
common/fillername3: I still don't get why ruling the world is so necessary in your plans.
common/fillername4: Pshhhh, You're no fun. The people will looooove me, and cherish me, and it'll happen naturally!!!
common/fillername3: I don't trust you...Dummy.
common/fillername4: YOU'RE THE DUMMY!!! Dummy, dummy, dummydummydummy ðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµðŸŽµ
But what happened next surprised me. [n+]\
They began to draw line after line after line, interwoven with blocks and nestles.
Slowly, my eyes widened as I realized these things represented buildings, nestles, and industrial grottos.
[wait time="1.0"]
....I think I can see my house in there.
common/fillername3: Saturn, you're incredible!! You know the city so well!!
common/fillername4: So, we're standing riiiiiiiiight here. But if we travel off to the west, we can pick up some party members. [n+]\
My plan is for us to help enough people as to build up supporters, and then we can move on.
They were using the exact language I'd used yesterday to describe the video game we were playing.[n+]\
They must've picked up a plan overnight from thinking about the game alone...
common/fillername3: Is this a plan you've thought about for a long time?
Saturn holds for a moment. I can't read their facial expressions, but I can guess that question was loaded.
common/fillername4: [pause=0.5]I've looked down on this city quite a bit. [n+]\
From alleys, rooftops, balconies. I hear so many conversations passing by.
common/fillername4: I never approach directly. [n+]\
That's why not a single soul but you knows I exist!
Their words took a moment for me to process. [n+]\
I didn't speak it aloud, but I found that idea alarming. I began to think about all the previous suspicions I had of where they could even be from.
common/fillername4: Combing through the night this way is my normal.[n+]\
Which is why it's always so surprising to me when I listen in on regular people, and realize they're all lonelier than me.
common/fillername4: I just thought, that I've spent so much time being insignificant to everyone.[n+]\
Couldn't I be the one to change something?

We spoke as we walked. They were taking me up the path they had drawn in the gravel.[n+]\
I realized now more than ever that Saturn really meant what they said about wanting to be a hero.
[sound path="res://vn/sfx/ch2/anime-46068.mp3" volume="0.0"]
common/fillername3: ....!!
Once we touched the pavement, they began to hold my hand again.[n+]\
...If my eyes aren't closed, we don't need to be doing this, right?
Maybe it was my imagination, but they must've been shaking a little.
common/fillername4: ....Eeeepp!!!
And just as they began to hold it, that touch left my palm.
Despite the big talk about "recruiting", Saturn was still resorting to their survival tactics--hiding behind any alleyway the moment we got near a person.
Since I'm still wearing an elaborate get-up, I get many strange looks as I walk "alone" along the pavement. [n+]\
People casually crossing the street to the opposite side the moment they see me.
Usually, I hate this type of awkwardness, but the anonymity the suit lends me is surprisingly comforting.[n+]\
I understand how Saturn feels now.
[pause=0.3]Eventually, the hand I had been tugging forward came to a stop.[n+]\
I looked to see what the hold-up was, and they were enraptured in a store display's commercial.
It was a video game, a flashily coloured fighting game with superheroes fighting each other.[n+]\
If my ears hadn't maligned me, I think I heard them mutter "So cool...."...
common/fillername4: Hey, it didn't say if it was for the game thing you had.[pause=0.3]..Do you think I could still play it?
common/fillername3: I think I have that game at home.
common/fillername4: [lspeed=0.1].....\
[lspeed=0.01]YOU HAVE A HOME?!
...Do they not?
common/fillername4: Ahaha...I thought I was the only one!!!\
I bet yours doesn't compare to this beautiful garden, though.
common/fillername3: Garden? What grows here?
common/fillername4: You, ya dummy!! *You* grew from beneath me!!
[wait time="3.0" hide_text="false"]
This kid sure is weird.[n+]\
But, they've been so nice to me, shouldn't I repay them just this once?
common/fillername3: [pause=0.3][lspeed=0.08]Hey, Saturn, I have an idea.[n+]\
This might be crazy, but...if you want to play that game so bad, do you want to come to my place?
common/fillername4: Ehehe...No one's ever invited me to their home before!![n+]\
Sure, it'll be a playdate!!
*Oh...god.*[n+]\
It only settled in my mind after saying it that this is the riskiest thing I've ever promised to do.
Just looking at them, I could tell they had interpreted this no other way than "let's go, right now."\
They had calmed right down; my suggestion was the thing getting them through this.
common/fillername3: What about your plans of world domination thing? You leaving that for another night?
common/fillername4: I think I underprepared...Tomorrow though, it begins for REAL! Just you wait!!
They said it with a defensive inflection, as if I was thinking they were a coward.[n+]\
I figured I'd just leave it for now.

It usually wasn't a long trip home from this part of town, but Saturn's shyness added a lot of delays. \
But eventually, we ended up here--standing before a lone windowsill in my backyard.
Saturn hadn't spoken up on it yet.[n+]\
This was when I was most certain they didn't have a good relationship with their own home. Did they even have one?
I crawled through the window, and they followed my lead.
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch2/bedroomch2.png" fade="2.0"]

I looked at the clock. It was just past midnight.[n+]\
I knew my parents were already deep asleep at this point[pause=0.1]--which relieved me--[pause=0.1]but asked them to keep their voice down.
We looked through my shelf, and[lspeed=0.3].......[lspeed=0.08]there it was!!![n+]\
The bright logo-work on the game's box practically shone out in the dark.

[wait time="1.0"]
common/fillername4: I-I...didn't realize you were apart of the light world.
common/fillername3: Huh?
common/fillername4: You seemed lonely to me, but you have so much...[n+]\
I thought we might've been more similar. You even have two whole parents.
common/fillername3: Ahh, Saturn...\
I'm not lying when I say I was so lonely before meeting you. My world was so empty.
common/fillername4: Oh, really?[pause=0.3] ...I don't get it.
common/fillername3: It's complicated, my time in this world--despite everything--is complicated.[n+]\
Maybe not in comparison to what you've been through, but I'll try my best to describe it.

So, I told them everything. [n+]\
I told him it was my birthday yesterday. I told him that I stayed in my room playing video games all day.
I told them that I hadn't been able to make a single friend since I moved here.[n+]\
I told them that the loneliness was finally getting to me.
It wasn't that I hated socializing at school. I told them It wasn't even the people's faults.[n+]\
They could be mean, but many of them seemed to get along certainly fine with each other.
It was something simpler than that.[n+]\
It was like there were barriers between me and others.
I could barely describe it in words. The average person had the type of personality I couldn't reach.[n+]\
I wanted to touch other'ss hearts-- I wanted them to touch my heart--but words weren't working.
And what was left other than words? [n+]\
Where could I go next, what could I try next? It's not like they teach you that.
And I told them that I wanted to kill myself, because there was nothing I could do about that solitude.[n+]\
Adults don't like when children say those kinds of words. They say they're overreacting.
But dammit, I just wanted someone to my feelings to stop bouncing off others.
I told them that I wanted to touch someone, and for them to understand--for it to mean something to that someone.
...Eventually, I ran out of steam to keep ranting on, and everything fell silent again.[n+]\
It took a few more rounds for Saturn to speak up.
common/fillername4: [pause=0.5][lspeed=0.1].......[lspeed=0.01]I think I understand a little more about the human world's problems.
Ignoring their strange phrases once again, I wondered what they meant by that.
common/fillername4: I'll have to take this changing the world stuff more seriously.[n+]\
When I peer into it...everyone seems so isolated from each other.
They put the controller down, and stepped towards the window.[n+]\
I had feared that I scared them off, but they gave one last sardonic giggle.

I like you a lot.
common/fillername4: I did some reflecting tonight. I wanted to change the world for my own sake, because I hated living in it.[n+]\
I realize that now, you're my biggest motivation. Let's switch it up on your world too.
And with those final words, they were gone.[n+]\
I'll see you tomorrow, I guess.
