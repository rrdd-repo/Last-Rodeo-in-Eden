I didn't remember much about that fateful night.
I didn't remember if my parents had even saw; if they had closed the door already, if my Mom was traumatized or whatever.
But I was forced into therapy not too long after.[n+]\
My parents could pick up that something was wrong, that I wasn't keeping it together anymore.
I hadn't told them about how hard school social life had been; I had considered it a personal failing I had to pursue fixing on my own.
But most of all, the days after that were such a blur because...the friend who lit up my night was gone.
Never would I see Saturn again. What once had overcame my entire life--becoming the center of my daily joys and suffering--was gone in the blink of one night.
The first emotion to replace it was an overbearing emptiness.
Not a single night went by I didn't think about climbing out of that window one more time,[pause=0.5] chasing the one place in the world I felt like I had something.
But with time, my heart healed. The emptiness was replaced with a sense of fulfillment that I was living for things in this life, and so I got used to this life.
Time passed. As I grew up, I'd slowly learn more things about myself that explained why everyone in my life felt so hard to understand.
I'd take counseling further as in my late teens. The psychiatrist gave me a diagnosis--guidance that helped me figure out why I felt so inexplicable compared to everyone else.
Reaching out to others through that counseling helped close the wounds. Not only was I not alone in this world, but lots of people similar to me equally couldn't fathom I existed in their world.
Ack, the teenage years feel so wrong if you spend them alone.[n+] It's pitiful to think about how hard the process of simply learning that there's more like us on a planet so huge can be.
And as I enter my adult years--not to brag, but...I feel a bit pretty satisfied with myself these days.[n+]\
The friends I keep in touch with over the internet are valuable, but I know good hang-out spots too.
My aspirations as a musician are going well. Soul searching lead me to picking up a drum-set; I'd play it 'till my knees gave out.[n+] That movement kept blood pumping into my heart when people wouldn't.
[lspeed=0.1]...[lspeed=0.01]So, why do I still feel sad sometimes?
It comes up a lot when talking to my therapist. I've filled what wasn't there now, but I feel a pain rooted to the past, a retrospective hurting. Sadness from regret of running away.
The dreams I see that old friend in seem like proof to me that I'm not good at scribbling over those memories of our time spent together.
The way I cut them off was so sudden, maybe I never processed it's over--that they wouldn't worm their way back into the daily bustle.
There was nothing else in my life making me happy at the time. So as those unimportant details fade from my brain, it makes the memories of Saturn become massive in comparison.
And so when I close my eyes, I see them. They chase me until they can grab ahold of me and comfort me; a barrage of contradictory emotions come to light each night.
And what I've come to understand of what that represents is that I feel my childhood is still incomplete. That I wished I could go back in time and fill it with some of the excess homeliness I feel now.

I stepped out of the car.[n+]\
On my way to my destination, I decided to take a detour to a sandwich shop I spotted. I had gotten there right before the night swallowed the chance of anything being open.
A bald man with a toothy but sincere smile was standing at the clerk.[n+]\
I didn't recognize him; you leave home for a second, and just about *anything* you could recognize is gone.
As a kid, I never had any opportunities to buy this sorta thing.[n+]\
I had remembered thinking one of the items on the menu looked so tasty....
....Though, I couldn't remember which item it was that struck me at the time. [n+]\
*sigh*. As an adult, these options all carry an equal luxury to me.
I carried the still-warm wrapping in my hand as I crossed the street to my destination. And just as I knew it, I arrived at the park.

This was the last time I had marked off as wanting to do in my vacation back at my parent's home.[n+]\
I had kept it as the least important thing on my bucket-list; I usually write off nostalgia.
Last time I had come here, it was to try and *find something*.[n+]\
To fill a void that was tearing away at me with any emotion at all.
Now I've got loads of "something", but the stupid part of me still wants more.[n+]\
How greedy.
After taking a seat on the bench next to the gym equipment, I opened the wrapper, taking a bite into the sandwich thats smell had been invading my senses for minutes by now.

...Take a bite, little guy. Things are gonna get better, I promise.
[wait time="1.0"]
This is stupid. [n+]I was waiting for any of this to make me feel something, but nothing was happening.[n+]\
Nostalgia sure is fickle. I never feel it when I try the most to.

My train of thought is interrupted by the tapping of metal reverberating through the nearby playground equipment. A soft rumble, followed by a squeaaaaak and swoosh.
When I turned to it, I was met with an odd sight. Someone had been using the nearby slide at this time of night?
Squinting, I got a look at their proportions. Clearly they weren't a kid; at least I'm not being a witness to the irresponsibility of any parents.
Once they had gotten up, they just went back to climbing up the slide and riding down again.[n+] \
They repeated this two or three more times before noticing me. (Smelled my sandwich, huh?)
Like a wolf's eyes reflecting off headlights, their stare burrows into my eyes as they steadily walk closer.
My stomach cramps hard. My body recognized that I was afraid before my mind did.
Getting a good look at them for the first time, I can see they're a shorter man; chubby in the stomach, but boney around the neck. Their face is that of a kid's.\
The skin on it is covered in old wounds and burn marks.
[wait time="0.5"]
They gained the courage to speak up before I did.
saturn: What brings an old reverend like you here at this time of night? [lspeed=0.1]Ehehehe..
john: I had unfinished business here.
saturn: We got an action hero here, huh?[n+]\
Coming home from the war after all this time!! Eeeehehehe!!
I couldn't get a read on if they were more or less insane, but there was something eerie about speaking to them.[n+]\
Their mannerisms hadn't changed a bit since we last spoke. It was like I was talking to a memory.
john: You kept to your word, huh... You never went after me.
saturn: My fun with you was over,[pause=0.3] I had other toys to play with.\
I did wonder when you'd crawl back to me, though, kyeh..
john: Your "other toys" were some freaks, man.[n+]\
You made the wrong choice, [pause=0.3]though I can't blame you. We were little kids.
saturn: I shouldn't have humored you for so long. [pause=0.3]I thought you had potential.[n+]\
But you were just like the others. [pause=0.5]It's a shame, really!!
john: Bleh. [pause=0.5]You've gotten so gross.
Like they were following a script, Saturn abruptly shifted tone without further reaction to what I had said.
saturn: You thought I wouldn't noticed all the promises you never fulfilled, right?[n+]\
You wanna know something? I caught your first lie.
john: What are you...talking about?
I scanned my brain for whatever opportunity I even would've had to lie.
saturn: And since then, you were nothing but disappointment, disappointment, disappointment!![n+]\
Well, you wanna know something? This old dog doesn't forget or forgive.
I saw them put their hand into their pocket and feel around for a few moments, before whipping out something it took my eyes a moment to comprehend.[n+]\
A beautiful silver now sat in their palm.
[sound path="res://vn/sfx/ch5/revolver-spin-96947.mp3" volume="0.0"]
It was a silver revolver, wasn't it? Like the ones in the old movies?[n+]\
They spun around to face away from me, holding it high up into the air.
saturn: I say we settle this, [pause=0.3]here and now. [n+]Back then, it wasn't a fair fight at all, [pause=0.3]but now it's a classical duel!! [n+]\
Ehehee...[pause=0.3]ahhhh, I shouldn't laugh now. [pause=0.3]You're probably totally scared.
I must not be processing emotions at all right now.[n+]\
Saturn was posed up like an old cowboy, and my eyes had already drifted elsewhere.
[pause=0.1][lspeed=0.08]Their...back. The chewed up shirt I saw.[n+]\
Ah. I think I know which lie they're talking about.
HeheheHAHAHA....they must've been looking behind their back, just waiting for me to slip up the whole time. [n+]\
Never trusted me at all, huh?
They might be nothing more than another little freak at this point, but I can't help but feel bad regardless.
john: Listen, Saturn.[n+] I'm sorry for...[n+]everything.[n+]\
I was just a little kid,[n+] and I didn't know how to tell a good decision from bad.
john: I hold some reservations,[n+] but I think I can find some way to pay you back.[n+]\
I think you deserve a little better than me.
saturn: You know what, Yggy? I think you were wrong back then, we are a bit alike.[n+]\
Because no matter how much you abused me, I still love you!!
saturn: Soooo,[pause=0.3] after I make you repent a little, I'm gonna take you [lspeed=0.1]riiiiight[lspeed=0.01] back with me.[n+]\
We'll never separate again!!
saturn: We'll never fight again, and we'll find our own little outcrop on this wretched earth!! Isn't that wonderful?[n+]\
I bet you've waited patiently for that freedom as well!!!
The last emotion on my mind at that point was genuine disgust.[n+]\
If poverty leaves Saturn with nothing left to think about other than me, then maybe this earth is a shitstain.
john: Draw.
[[aa=0.5]Saturn twirled around, and--

It feels like I've been asleep forever...[n+]\
I returned to reality in slow motion. In minutes, hours, or seconds, I realized I was in a hospital.
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch5/hospitalbed.png" fade="0.5"]
But more confusingly...[n+]\
Why was I alive?
I had been spared, for whatever reason.[n+]\
I don't get it. Was all talk for nothing? Did the gunshot sound scare an onlooker?
All that talk about taking me back for nothing. Bleh.
[wait time="0.5"]
A nurse walked into the room, with an unbothered look on your face.
nurse: Patient, can I get your name?
john: John, I think.
nurse: John, you were recovered with a gunshot to the abdomen.[n+]\
We can help stabilize you, but extensive care may be expensive. Do you have the funds?
Ugh...[n+]\
As pathetic as it is to admit, this bullet-wound could still pull me into the darkness.
nurse: I'll check in on you later. We have a phone for you if you want to call any family members.
john: Later, thanks.[n+]\
I need some time to think.
She gave a professional smile and walked away.
The moment I had given myself a moment to think, the dam broke.[n+]\
Every emotion--every side of me--had burst out all at once.

common/protagonist: This is all my fault!!![n+]\
If I had done more to help him back then, maybe things wouldn't have gone so wrong....
john: Did I really owe them that, though?[n+]\
I wanted to help them, but It's not my responsibility to be their brain.
common/fillername3: But they were all I had. [n+]\
I could've fought harder for them, and it would've been worth it.
john: If they were swayed that easily, it was inevitable they'd be manipulated.
common/fillername3: I just had no idea how to stop them from being manipulated.[n+]\
I ruled out anyone other than me being able to help, after all.
common/protagonist: But there was no one else in that world I could trust.\
I was alone. My parents were deeply afraid of anyone who wasn't at my school or our neighbors.
john: As an adult, I understand the wider social context for why my parents were so scared of anyone who wasn't on the school registry.[n+]\
That whole generation got groomed into sensationalism.
john: We grew up in the razors-in-halloween-candy decade.[n+]\
It could never have had any other outcome.
common/fillername3: Which is why in a sense--Saturn was totally right.[n+]\
If we wanted to save people like them, we had to change the world for the better!! We could've fought harder!!
common/fillername3: We could've made educational videos or something, could've convinced our parents through our teachers.[n+]\
Could've done something. Maybe if we tried hard enough, we'd find something.
john: Ehehe...thinking about how I could change the past is just idealism.[n+]\
I should let go of all of this, and just try to be a better person now.
common/protagonist: But..how can we forgive ourselves for the past, when the future hasn't changed?[n+]\
Saturn is still out there, in a world that never found a place for them.
common/fillername3: That world made us all worse. It's a miracle I made it out of there myself.[n+]\
No one was in control of that situation.
common/protagonist: If the chance of a good outcome was always that slim, were our parents right to butt their heads in, to stop those interactions from happening?
john: Thinking like that makes me feel incredibly, incredibly sad.[n+]\
Their fear of it is exactly why we couldn't find a way to make it safer.
common/fillername3: When we grow up, I guess we'll have to become the future generation that's more open-minded about this sorta thing.
common/fillername3: Both Saturn and I grew up in solitude.[n+]\
Solitude is what made our bond so strong, but its what made them so susceptible to other isolated people's manipulation.
And we were as susceptible to that damage as they were.[n+]\
\
But for some reason, only they're the one with the heart that could never heal.
I was...so lucky. [n+]\
I was never as burdened by it as them, but here I am--stuck in some hospital bed.
Even considering the thought that the old guard was right to judge Saturn, just because the worst outcome came to fruition.[n+]\
I couldn't believe what I was thinking.
I had been stupid this whole time not to realize that.[n+]\
I had been stupid to think for a second that my heart wasn't in the right place to keep searching.
common/fillername3: Then I guess I can't ever give up that childish wish.
To try and change the world, make it a better place\: that is the life of a magical girl.

When I closed my eyes, I was in a dream.[n+]\
In that dream, I towered above everybody.
And in that city I stood above, I could tell that my work was still needed.[n+]\
Even though it was a kind town, with many people much smarter and wiser than I ever could be.
I could tell, because even the kindest boys threw their stones and arrows at my feet.[n+]\
So I put my foot down.
[sound path="res://vn/sfx/ch1/big-punch-with-whoosh-103638.mp3" volume="0.0"]
Earthquakes erupted. The oceans shifted.[n+]\
And I started to smash, and smash, and smash. I tore away as long as I could, until the rubble was perfectly even.
[background arg="res://vn/backgrounds/ch1/dreamgarden.png" fade="2.0"]
[wait time="1.1"]
I knew my work was done, when all that was left was a garden. [n+]\
It was a beautiful garden, the most perfect one in the world. Even though nothing had grown yet.
Because in the middle, there was the littlest seed, that could grow into the most beautiful rainforest.[n+]\
The rainforest would bring life back to everyone. It needed to grow.
But it wasn't growing. Why?[n+]\
It must've been the weeds. I tried plucking them, but they wouldn't come out.
I asked all the graves what to do about that, and none knew.[n+]\
So I asked the seed, and it told me that it wanted the weeds to eat it.
So I pulled the seed out of the earth. [n+]\
If it can't feed off the invested gravel, then it will feed off me.
And so it got its nutrients from my heart, and I exchanged it for me.
It was a wonderful dream, one where I wouldn't be the one with this heartbreak.[n+]\
So as the last droplet of my heart was sipped, the dream ended.
